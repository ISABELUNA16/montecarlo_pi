# Making rain fall in a field so as to estimate pi.

This repo contains some code that simulates rain fall in a square field and counts the number of drops that fall in an inscribed circle so as to estimate pi.

## Usage

    python Estimate_pi.py 500

This returns:

    ----------------------
    500 drops
    pi estimated as:
        3.112
    ----------------------

*but* also outputs a plot:

![500 drops](500_drops.png)

If we have 100,000 drops we get:

![100,000 drops](100000_drops.png)

If we have 1,000,000 drops we get:

![1,000,000 drops](1000000_drops.png)
